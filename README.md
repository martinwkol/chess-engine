# Chess Engine (Work in Progress)

This project is an experimental chess engine currently under development.  
The strategies and algorithms are inspired by [chessprogramming.org](https://www.chessprogramming.org/).

## Build

The project uses **CMake** with two available presets:
- `debug` — for development builds 
- `release` — for optimized builds

> ⚙️ **Note:** The code currently compiles only with C++ compilers defining `__GNUC__`.
